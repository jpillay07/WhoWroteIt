# WhoWroteIt
This app fetches author information for any book. Simply enter a book title and the app fetches the author information from the Google Books API. The data fetching process is performed on the bacground thread using AsyncTask (First commit). The second commit uses AsyncTaskLoader so that any UI configuration changes does not affect the fetching and displaying of data.
